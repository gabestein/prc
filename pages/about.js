				Future You is an anti-budgeting tool that helps you learn to pay your future self to
				stop facing financial stress and start living your life.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most budgeting apps and techniques are like diets: great in theory, but not
				practical to follow for most people. Future You is different: you don&apos;t need to
				give every dollar a job. You don&apos;t need to set budgets for 100 categories. You
				don&apos;t need to feel guilty or stressed because you spent an extra dollar at a
				bar.
			</p>
			<p>
				Future You is simple: you start by being honest about what&apos;s a normal expense
				and what&apos;s a treat. Then, you start treating your future self as much as you do
				your present self. As you succeed, Future You guides you through more advanced
				strategies to meet your financial needs in life without agonizing budgeting.
			</p>
			<p>
				Future You is built for all types of people. If you&apos;re just getting started
				getting your money under control, Future You offers simple and proven strategies to
				help you get there. If you&apos;ve already got things under control, Future You is
				the simplest and most elegant tool for keeping tabs on your money. In the near
				future, Future You will also support advanced strategies for the most driven
				personal optimizers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unlike most other apps, Future You charges money for use. That&apos;s because Future
				You is not making money from selling or analyzing your data. Future You is not
				trying to sell you financial products or advising services. Future You is not
				venture funded and will never sell to a company that does&apos;t share its values.
			</p>
			<p>
				Future You was started by two friends: one a lifelong finance enthusiast who wanted
				the perfect tool for keeping tabs on his habits, the other new to thinking about
				money who wanted basic guidance for getting his financial life stable.
